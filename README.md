# Create-A-Thon
This is the repo where I'll commit all my code for internity create-a-thon.

## Lambda Code
Our backend is hosted on AWS Lambda. I have provided code in index.js file. I have omitted dataurl of database server and alexa skill id. You need to update it with your own resource, if you are want to see this project working.
