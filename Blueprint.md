A product which helps users to manage his health reports. Patients with chronic disease usually do not have a detailed report. eg. people suffering with Diabetes checks their sugar level twice or thrice a day but they do not make a record of it. When they go for a consultation, they give a vague idea to the doctor.


## Description of Solution/Product provided
We are making a solution in which user can easily make health records and share it with their doctors. Our solution is inclined towards a “Alexa”. User can talk with Alexa and all his data can be stored with a single voice utterance.
